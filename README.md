# Automated Attendance System with Face Recognition

## Overview

The "Automated Attendance System with Face Recognition" is a sophisticated project designed to simplify and enhance the process of recording and managing student attendance. Leveraging advanced face recognition technology, this system automates attendance tracking, making it accurate, efficient, and user-friendly.

## Key Features

- **Face Recognition Technology:** Utilizes cutting-edge face recognition technology for automated student identification based on facial features.

- **Real-time Attendance Tracking:** Marks attendance in real-time as students enter the designated area, eliminating manual attendance recording.

- **User-Friendly Interface:** Provides an intuitive graphical interface displaying essential information, including student details, date, and time.

- **Data Management:** Stores student information and attendance records in structured formats for easy management and analysis.

- **Photo Display:** Enhances user experience by displaying student photos alongside attendance records for visual verification.

- **Automatic Notifications:** Notifies users when their attendance is successfully marked, ensuring transparency and student awareness.

## How it Works

1. **Initialization:** The system initializes with pre-trained facial encodings.

3. **Face Detection:** As students enter the area, the system detects faces in real-time.

4. **Recognition:** Faces are matched against stored encodings to identify students.

5. **Attendance Marking:** When a student's face is recognized, their attendance is marked with a timestamp.

6. **User Interface Update:** The graphical interface displays student details and photos along with attendance records.

7. **Data Management:** Attendance data is stored in a CSV file for real-time access or export.
